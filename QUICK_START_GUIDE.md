### Understanding Your Dashboard

#### Top Stats
- **Total Assignments**: All assessments assigned to you
- **In Progress**: Assessments you're currently working on
- **Completed**: Finished assessments
- **Next Actions**: Steps ready to start right now

#### Assessment Cards
Each assessment shows:
- Site name and code
- Who assigned it to you
- When it was assigned and when it's due
- Overall progress percentage
- Current phase (Desk/Field/Reporting)
- Ready-to-start steps

### Starting Your Work

#### View Workflow Button
- Click to see all 15 steps in the assessment
- Green = completed
- Blue = in progress
- White with blue ring = ready to start
- Grey = blocked (waiting on other steps)

#### Start Next Step Button
- Takes you directly to the tool you need
- Automatically marks the step as "in progress"
- No guessing what to do next!

### The Three Phases

#### Phase 1: Desk Research (Steps 1-5)
What you'll do:
- Review historical site data
- Use GIS Mapping to analyze spatial data
- Search databases (NPWS, EPA) for species/habitat info
- Review climate data
- Compile findings into a desk research report

Tools you'll use:
- GIS Mapping
- Data Mine
- Your notes and observations

#### Phase 2: Field Research (Steps 6-10)
What you'll do:
- Plan your field survey route
- Conduct habitat condition surveys on-site
- Record species observations
- Calculate ecological impacts
- Document with photographs

Tools you'll use:
- Field Survey
- Impact Calculation
- Camera/photo upload

#### Phase 3: Reporting (Steps 11-15)
What you'll do:
- Run data quality checks
- Perform statistical analysis
- Generate assessment report
- Submit for peer review
- Finalize report with feedback

Tools you'll use:
- Data Validation
- Reporting
- Review system

### Understanding Dependencies

**Why can't I start Step 7?**
- Some steps depend on others being completed first
- Step 7 (Habitat Survey) requires Step 6 (Plan Survey) to be done
- Look for the "Depends on:" text under each step
- This ensures you don't skip important preparation

**What does "Blocked" mean?**
- The step is waiting for something else to be completed
- Complete the dependency steps first
- The system will automatically unblock it

### Data Quality Checks

**When to validate:**
- Before moving to the next phase
- After entering significant field data
- Before generating final reports

**How to validate:**
1. Click "Run Validation" button
2. Review errors (red) and warnings (yellow)
3. Fix any errors before proceeding
4. Warnings are suggestions but not required

**Common validation issues:**
- Missing species names
- Incorrect coordinate format (use: 51.8985,-8.4756)
- Negative population counts
- Missing survey dates

### Quick Access Buttons

At the bottom of your dashboard:
- **GIS Mapping**: Analyze spatial data anytime
- **Data Mine**: Search databases anytime
- **Field Survey**: Record field observations
- **Generate Report**: Create assessment reports

### Tips for Success

1. **Check your dashboard daily** - New tasks may be assigned
2. **Complete steps in order** - Don't skip ahead
3. **Validate often** - Catch errors early
4. **Document everything** - Add notes as you work
5. **Ask for help** - Use the Review feature if stuck

## Troubleshooting

### I can't find my assignment
- Check you're in "Child (User)" view
- Assignments only show for the user they're assigned to
- Ask admin if you think you should have an assignment

### Step won't start
- Check if it has dependencies (grey lock icon)
- Complete the required steps first
- Dependencies are listed under each step

### Validation errors won't clear
- Read the error message carefully
- Fix the exact field mentioned
- Re-run validation
- Some errors require specific formats (dates, coordinates)

### I accidentally completed wrong step
- Contact administrator
- They can use version history to restore
- Don't try to "undo" - it may cause issues

### Data didn't save
- Data saves automatically as you work
- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page to see latest version
- Use version history to recover if needed
